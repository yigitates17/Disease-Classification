# Disease-Classification
This study compares the performance of four machine learning algorithms - SVM, LR, 
Random Forests, and GBM - for the multiclass classification of diseases, using a dataset 
taken from the Kaggle dataset repository. The study also addresses the challenge of 
small data size and high dimensionality. By optimizing hyperparameter tuning, the 
research explores the performances of each algorithm in a small multiclass dataset 
where the symptoms are represented as binary (0 or 1), in terms of accuracy, precision, 
recall, F1 score, and sensitivity, providing insights for future improvements in medical 
classification applications of machine learning.
